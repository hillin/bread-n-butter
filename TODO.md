- Add more tutorials
- Add more examples
- Add benchmarks?
- Add user values to context?
- Should `Context` be an interface and I have an internal not-exported class
  that implements it instead?
- Add equivalents to `.skip` and `.then` from Parsimmon
- Add `bnb.all` function (like `Parsimmon.seq`) and look at `Promise.all` to see
  how to do the type level magic to make it not awful for TS users
